        The history of Indian Railways dates back to over 160 years ago. On 16th
        April 1853, the first passenger train ran between Bori Bunder (Bombay) and
        Thane, a distance of 34 km. It was operated by three locomotives, named
        Sahib, Sultan and Sindh, and had thirteen carriages. The photo to the right,
        while capturing a scene from the early days of railways in India, features a
        train pulled by a single locomotive, and is widely - but incorrectly - believed
        to be that first service.
        Just a couple of years after that first train, the engineers of the Indian Railway took up the colossal task of building a track over Bhore Ghat.

Built at an elevation of 2000 feet, to connect Bombay with Poona, with tunnels and reverse viaducts, the track was finally constructed over a period of nine years and at great human cost.
1862: The Jamalpur Workshop
The first Railway Workshop was established at Jamalpur, near Munger, Bihar, in 1862. It gradually became one of the major industrial unit of India, with iron and steel foundries, rolling mills and more.
In 1864, the north got its first station - the Delhi Junction. The oldest one of the city, it was a major station and junction and remains so till date.

It was first established near Chandni Chowk in 1864 when trains from Howrah/Calcutta started operating up to Delhi. The current building was made operational in 1903.
Indian Railways is among the world’s largest rail network. Indian Railways route length network is spread over 1,23,236 kms, with 13,452 passenger trains and 9,141 freight trains plying 23 million travellers and 3 million tonnes (MT) of freight daily from 7,349 stations. India's railway network is recognised as one of the largest railway systems in the world under single management.

The railway network is also ideal for long-distance travel and movement of bulk commodities, apart from being an energy efficient and economic mode of conveyance and transport. Indian Railways is the preferred carrier of automobiles in the country.

Government of India has focused on investing in railway infrastructure by making investor-friendly policies. It has moved quickly to enable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in railways to improve infrastructure for freight and high-speed trains. At present, several domestic and foreign companies are also looking to invest in Indian rail projects
Indian Railways’ revenue increased at a CAGR of 6.20 per cent during FY08-FY19 to US$ 27.13 billion in FY19. Earnings from the passenger business grew at a CAGR of 6.43 per cent during FY07-FY19 to reach US$ 7.55 billion in FY19P. Freight revenue rose at a CAGR of 4.30 per cent during FY08-FY19 to reach US$ 18.20 billion in FY19.

Revenue growth has been strong over the years. Indian Railways’ gross revenue stood at Rs 183,092.74 crore (US$ 26.20 billion) in FY20 (till February 2020). Freight earnings in FY20 (till February 2020) stood at Rs 119,216.11 crore (US$ 17.06 billion). Passenger earnings for Indian Railways was estimated at 51,077.73 crore (US$ 7.31 billion) in FY20 (till February 2020). Freight remains the major revenue earning segment for Railways, accounting for 65.1 per cent of its total revenue in FY20 (till February 2020), followed by the passenger segment
